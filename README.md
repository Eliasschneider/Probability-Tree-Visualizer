# Probabilty tree Simulator/Visualizer

This script is used to simulate a probabilty tree, it uses turtle to visualize the tree. 
 
 ### Usage:
 
Execute the script using `python3 [filename] [1] [2] [3]`

Change [filename] to the name of the script fx. `python3 tree_vis_v0.2.py [1] [2] [3]`
Change [1], [2] and [3] to three numbers you want to simulate, with [1] being the amount of "red", [2] being the amount of "green" and [3] the amount of "blue".
[1], [2] and [3] have to add up to exact 10.

### Replit:
If you don't want to download the script you can execute it on replit [here](https://replit.com/@eliasschneider/Visualize-probabilty-tree). Keep in mind that the replit script always runs with the numbers [3] [4] [3].
